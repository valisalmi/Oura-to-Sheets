This app is for personal use only. It requests access to my Oura sleep and heart-rate data via the Oura Cloud API. Collected data: bedtime, wake time, total sleep, sleep efficiency, and HRV. Data is stored only in my personal Google Sheets and in Google Apps Script properties used to store API tokens. Data is not shared, sold, or published. Tokens are stored privately in Google account properties and not committed to this repository. Retention: data is kept until I delete it.
